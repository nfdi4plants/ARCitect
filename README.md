# ARCitect

The **ARCitect** is a cross-platform app to create and manage your **ARCs** and synchronize them with the **DataHUB**.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect/releases/latest)
2. From ****Assets**** download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

    - **Windows**:  ARCitect-x.x.xx-win.zip
    - **macOS**: ARCitect-x.x.xx-universal.dmg
    - **Debian-based Linux systems**: ARCitect-x.x.xx_amd64.deb
    - **Non-Debian-based Linux systems**: You will need to build ARCitect from source as outlined below.

3. Follow the installation instructions in the [Knowledge Base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect).

## Building from source

To build ARCitect from source you need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a> and <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/" target="_blank">Git LFS</a> installed first.

1. Clone this repository and install its dependencies via npm
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCitect
cd ARCitect
npm install
```

2. Start the app in debugging mode

```bash
npm start
```


1. (optional) Compile the app for your operating system
   
(optional) Install sub modules, this must be done once for each setup otherwise the files will be missing in compiled ARCitect

   1. Download Swate: Run `./scripts/downloadSwate.ps1` (windows) or `./scripts/downloadSwate.sh` (linux). Without this you must fallback to production version of Swate
   2. Download Git binaries. Tracked via submodule can be pulled via: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

```bash
npm run compile # for linux
npm run compilew # for windows
npm run compilem # for mac    
```

The compiled installer is created in `dist/`.

### Release

1. Increase `package.json` semver.
2. (OPTIONAL) Update `TAG_NAME` in `/scripts/downloadSwate.sh` to the latest Swate release tag.
2. Commit and push any changes!
3. Create tag `git tag <Placeholder>`, where `<Placeholder>` must be equal to `package.json` version.
4. Push tag with `git push origin <Placeholder>`.
5. This should trigger gh-action ðŸŽ‰

### Debugging on environment without git

I added a config file for a windows sandbox in `/scripts/startWindowsSandbox.wsb`. Will start virtual machine with windows and WITHOUT git, that has access to `/dist` folder to test compiled ARCitect versions.
