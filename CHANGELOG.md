## [Unreleased]

### ✨ Added

- Added a button to the Bug Report View to open the developer console #454 (by @Thyra and @Brilator).
- Regularly check if updates are available on a remote and notify user, related to #450 (by @Thyra)
- Git operations (push, pull, commit, etc.) can now be minimized to run in the background. A floating button appears in the bottom-right corner showing the operation status with visual indicators (hourglass for running, checkmark for success, error icon for failure). Users can continue working while long-running operations complete, and can restore the dialog at any time to view progress. All git operation and LFS file download buttons are disabled while another git operation is running to prevent conflicts (by @Thyra)

## 1.4.0 - 2025-12-03

### ✨ Added

- Files without view support by ARCitect will open a default view with a button allowing the user to open them with the default application. This feature was also added for all files in the context menu #455 (by @Thyra, @Freymaurer)
- Auto save changes via Markdown editor when switching files or closing Markdown editor #428 (by @Thyra)
- Added error handling for file write operations. This will now show a modal if a file could not be written to disc, instead of printing to console. This can for example happen if a file should be written that is already open in another tool. (by @Freymaurer)
- When selecting LFS files which are not downloaded yet, ARCitect will display a view explaining that and allowing the user to download the file #466 (by @Thyra)

### 🔄 Changed

- Increased file watcher timeout behavior after saving an ARC (by @Etschbeijer)
- Changed opinionated LFS behavior. LFS will now always push and never default on pul #413 #458 (by @Thyra) 
- Simplified the commit user interface a bit (by @Thyra)

### 🐛 Fixed

- Fixed issue where LFS blacklist was not being applied correctly #431, #453 (by @Thyra)
- Fixed image reading from local file system (by @Thyra)
- Fixed update verification on investigation files (by @Freymaurer)
- Fixed swate view update after external file changes to correctly reflect changes (by @Freymaurer)
